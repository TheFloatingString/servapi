# servapi

A server-based interface for minimal API calls. 

Features:

+ Single object locally that dynamically generates attributes and methods that mirror the parent dependency
+ Securely call API keys (experimental, should **not** be used in a production setting)
+ Integrate functional programming capabilities (i.e. pipe operators)
